# Want to contribute?

At the moment of writing this document, the project is still in the early stages of development. 
In the following paragraphs, I will explain the types of PR I would accept.

### Bugs.
When you find a bug in the system, I would appreciate you opening a new issue. I will do my best to fix the problem in my free time. Or if
you can solve it yourself. You can do that. All PR should target the `main` branch. There is currently no `staging` or `development` branch. I
want to keep everything simple.

### New checks.
All the checks being executed are currently located in the rules folder. If you would like to implement your own rule, you can look at the current implementations. When you successfully write a new rule, you can open a PR with a detailed explanation of what your 
code is trying to detect in a PHP file. A PHP code example is also nice, so I can test it without writing PHP CODE.

### Documentation
The idea that I have in my mind is that all the rules should be documented for an inexperienced PHP developer. If you have experience with PHP
and you have an eye for beautiful; your help is welcome.
