# E00013 Private method not being used

Just remove the whole method. 👍

> Removing unused private methods from a PHP class offers several benefits. It improves code readability by eliminating clutter, enhances maintainability by simplifying the class structure, and boosts performance by reducing the size of the class definition. Additionally, it reinforces encapsulation and promotes codebase hygiene, reducing technical debt and improving overall code quality.
